# Greater Combination Mod
## The Ultimate Victoria II Mod 

The Greater Combination Mod (GCM) is a mod for Victoria II that aims to be as historically accurate as possible - both for specific events and overall trends - whilst also being dynamic and allowing for many different outcomes. As our (not-so-serious) motto states: "Every house a province, every man a pop, every thought a +1 prestige event."

Current projects include:
- Russia Rework: A total overhaul of Russia that will let Russia unite the Slavs, annihilate Britain in the Great Game, and build a grand Pacific empire - or fail in all three.
- Poland Rework: Origially starting as a part of the Russia Rework, it will be a total overhaul of Congress Poland, stimulating the leadup to the January Uprising and adding content - both for internal politics and external expansion - in case of a Polish victory.  
- Japan Rework: A partial overhaul of Japan up to around 1880, focused on accurately stimulating the leadup to the Boshin War and the steps taken after to modernize the country.

Planned projects include:
- US Rework: A total overhaul of the United States that will accurately stimulate the Slavery Debate, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and the Gilded Age - in other words, the struggles experienced by the US on its path to becoming a world power.
- 1848 Rework: An overhaul of the leadup to the Revolutions of 1848, fully representing the conditions that allowed for the Revolutions - both economic and political - as well as the full breadth of the actual Revolutions themselves.
- China Rework: A total overhaul of China with the goal of both accurately stimulating the struggles faced by the Qing Dynasty, as well as adding dynamicism to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Warlord Period - with content from real life up to the year 1960.
- Dynamic Colonization: An overhaul of colonization to more accurately stimulate the material factors that led to colonization (instead of just basing it off of technology), whilst retaining dynamicism in the fate of each colony. This will involve adding new native tags for multiple areas around the world (Western North America, Patagonia, the Amazon, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia), as well as reworking existing event chains to be more dynamic (Congo and railroaded colonization).
- Germany Rework: An expansion on existing Germany content to better stimulate the leadup to German unification, as well as reworking the Greater Germany path for Austria to be more realistic and adding options for the minor German states.
- Migration Rework: An ongoing rework focused on making migration more controllable, both by the player and developers - likely to focus on a rotation of migration between different tags. This will also involve adding examples of migration that are not currently stimulated in game, such as Asian migration to Southeast Asia and the Americas, shifts in emigration from Western to Eastern Europe, and colonial settlement in places like Canada, the US, South Africa, Central Asia, and Algeria.
