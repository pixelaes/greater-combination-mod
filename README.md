# Greater Combination Mod
 The Ultimate Victoria II Mod 

The Greater Combination Mod (GCM) is a mod for Victoria II that aims to be as historically accurate as possible, whilst also being fun and a unique experience for the player. As our (not-so-serious) motto states: "Every house a province, every man a pop, every thought a +1 prestige event."

Current projects include:
- Russia Rework: A total overhaul of Russia that will let Russia unite the Slavs, annihilate Britain in the Great Game, and build a grand Pacific empire - or fail in all three.
- Poland Rework: Origially starting as a part of the Russia Rework, it will be a total overhaul of Congress Poland, stimulating the leadup to the January Uprising and adding content - both for internal politics and external expansion - in case of a Polish victory.  
- Japan Rework: A partial overhaul of Japan up to around 1880, focused on accurately stimulating the leadup to the Boshin War and the steps taken after to modernize the country.

Planned projects include:
- US Rework: A total overhaul of the United States that will accurately stimulate the Slavery Debate, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and the Gilded Age - in other words, the struggles experienced by the US on its path to becoming a world power.
- China Rework: A total overhaul of China with the goal of both accurately stimulating the struggles faced by the Qing Dynasty, as well as adding dynamicism to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Warlord Period - with content from real life up to the year 1960.
